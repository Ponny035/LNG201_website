                  YouTube is a famous video platform where people can watch, upload or comment on videos. This website is mainly known for its entertainment’s videos. However, several video artists (youtubers) want to bring more than just entertainment and prefer to share their knowledge with us. It is another way to learn. On top of that, YouTube is easily accessible for everyone and the learning by videos can be fun.
                  We choose this topic because YouTube has an important place in our lives. Indeed, we use it every day but in different ways. Some of us use it to listen music, to laugh, to be informed about the news or even to learn. Therefore, we are curious to learn how people use YouTube as a learning platform.

                    <p>
                      The project for LNG201 Content based Language Learning, began on the 16th of January. The lecturer of this course was Ajarn David Hargrave Cook. The purpose of this project was to create and develop a website based on our research. That include a survey, 3 interviews and literature review references. The topic that we choose was “YouTube, powerful education platform”.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      The first week, we had to find a topic and select the team members. The members of the team are:
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Patipol Saechan (Pon)</li>
                    <li>Sabri Durand (Sabri)</li>
                    <li>Enso Merotto (Enzo)</li>
                    <li>Leo Tavernier (Leo)</li>
                  </ol>
                  <div class="col-md-12 text-center">
                    <p>
                           As a first step, we set the ground rules to have good working condition. We also selected Enzo as a team leader because he showed us that he was able to manage a team. Indeed, he is good at organization and communication.
                           After choosing our topic, we started to brainstorm and identify the different tasks that we had to do. We worked on an implementation plan to structure our work. That allowed us to know when we had to start a new task. At the same time, we found background information and the literature review references.
                      After that, we created the Gantt chart to illustrate the progression of our project. We also write the website proposal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The next week, we selected ten questions for our questionnaire. This questionnaire allowed us to create a good survey. The goal of the survey was to know why students are so much attracted by YouTube even to learn. So, we write a survey that can answer this question.
                      Then, we drafted Interview questions and we learned how to make a WIX website. We also started our website.
                      The next task was to conduct the interviews with the questions that we write.  We continued to develop the website. On top of that, we collected the information of the survey to start the description of each results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Finally, we had done the project consultation with Ajarn David Hargrave Cook.
                      The next step is the website presentation.

              <p>
                This first article is an analysis that has been made by the Canadian center of science and education. The purpose of this study was to compare the evolution of vocabulary comprehension and retention of 4 classes of 25 students. They made an evaluation of the level of English vocabulary and retention at the beginning of the study. They were charged to watch videos in English on YouTube every day during 2 weeks. The videos they were charged to watch were not videos about vocabulary or grammar.
                That was just funny videos that they enjoyed to watch. After two weeks they made the same evaluation about English vocabulary and retention. All of the students have significantly increased their comprehension about the vocabulary. But surprisingly most of them didn’t increase their level about talking in English. The center conclude that this study was really interesting because that was a proof that even if you are not studying you can improve your capabilities in English by using YouTube.
                They also conclude that this study could be applied to other fields to see if YouTube can also be useful for this other fields and maybe become a new tool in teaching.

              <br>
              <p>
                This second article was made by Oliver Dreon, Richar M. Kerper and Jon Landis, it is extracted from the middle school journal. This article is an analysis about how most of the humans are reacting when they see videos on YouTube. There is millions and millions of videos on YouTube, there is more video reference in YouTube than in any other platforms or social media. We estimate that in 2018, more than 80% of the active population was connected on YouTube each month. Some of the
                videos that we can find on YouTube have more than 6 billions of view. So we can say that most of the active humans like to watch videos. More than that, we can assume that the current generation and even more the young generation are formatted to watch videos. So they made an interesting experiment to see the reaction of people. In a public place they put 2 big rooms. In this rooms there were two things, in one of them there was a graduated teacher that was selected for his
                brilliant and attractive courses about quantum physics. In the other rooms they put a big screen with a course about the same subject as the professor but this time the course was chosen for his monotony. They placed some cameras to count the number of people in each room during the day. At the end of the day, there was more people that have seen the movie course than the real course. It’s an interesting study because we can see that even if a course is boring, just because it’s
                a course on a screen most of the people will prefer the movie course as the real course. It’s a proof that our generation is formatted to watch videos and also that if we can control the subject that people are watching, they can be taught without being aware of it.

              <p>
                This last article is an analysis of a study that has been made by Huda Omar Alwehaibi on a group of 95 students in an elementary school. The purpose of this study was to see if watching videos on YouTube can improve the English level of students that are not English native. There were 2 groups of student to better show the difference of the two way of teaching. One group will receive a traditional teaching and the other will receive a teaching more based on some videos on YouTube but also with a part of traditional teaching. This study lasted 6 weeks and the subjects were supposed to watch around 2 hours of videos per week. They also receive a teaching based on some power-point presentations. Another time the group that received the teaching more based on some YouTube videos and power-point presentation improve more his skills in English than the other. The teacher conclude that the fact of using some YouTube videos in addition of a traditional teaching could be an important teaching resource and he recommended to other teacher to use his method.

                After a calculation, the average of the time spends on YouTube by people is at least 3 hours, 1/8 of a day. So, YouTube is daily in the life of most people. It is interesting to know more about the use of YouTube as a learning platform with people who use it frequently during a time.              </P>

              <p><br>
                With this graph we can see that there are two types of person that use YouTube to learn. The first type, represented by the biggest part (“When you have free time”) use YouTube for their general knowledge, not for studies, so they watch videos when they have time. The second type is opposite of the first. People use YouTube for their studies, so they watch YouTube because they need to watch it to be better in school.              </P>

              <p><br>
                The most viewed topics are diversify, there are the scientific type of topics that appear the most, because the students are for the majority in a scientific faculty. But there are also many topics that are not scientific. For example: art, sport, general knowledge, music, makeup, gaming, cooking or interior design. The two-first type of topics (general knowledge and music) are not scientific topics. It means that it is not because students are in a scientific faculty that are not watch other type of topics.

                The most people vote that the quality of videos is good, but it is “only” 3/5. It seems that the most videos that they watch are in quality, but they saw also some videos with a bad quality. Mainly, the videos on YouTube are in a good quality.

              <p><br>
                With this last question, YouTube looks like a good learning platform. The reasons that appears the most are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ease to use and understand: To find videos that talk about the subject that we want to know more on YouTube, we just must do a search. The firsts videos that appear are generally the bests, so the quality is good, and it is easier to understand the content.</li><br>
                <li>Free: Anybody can watch a video to learn something, even without money.</li><br>
                <li>Variety and quantity: Everyone or most people that want to share a video to help people to learn something freely upload their videos on YouTube, so now there are 1460 billion of videos upload each year. In this big quantity of videos, there are some bad videos, but there are some very good videos. The firsts that appears after a search are the bests, so the quality is important on YouTube.</li>
